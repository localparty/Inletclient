## Known Issues

### Missing Offline Control
There is not a control for switching online/offline.

### Lowercase
The repository names are not lower case, the preferred case.

### API Usage
It is ambiguos wheter other API calls are needed for geting the data of the customer. Whti the current API sequence we seem to be retrieving all the info that is required.

#### Automating the Json responses build
Other brands have not been tested, prob. I should have the API writing the files that are retrieved from Inlet to simplify offline testing.
